\section{Question 1}
\subsection{Question}
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $S$ is an irreducible subset of a topological space $X$, prove that $\overline{S}$ (the closure of $S$) is again irreducible.
\item If $f: X \to Y$ is a continuous map of topological space, prove that $f(S)$ is irreducible for every irreducible subset $S$ of $X$.
\item If $f: X \to Y$ is a continuous map of topological spaces and $S \subset X$ is an irreducible closed subset admitting a generic point $x$ (i.e. $S = \overline{ \{ x\}}$), then $\overline{f(S)}$ is irreducible closed and admits $f(x)$ as a generic point (i.e. $\overline{f(S)} =\overline{ \{ f(x) \}}$).
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Answer}

\section{Question 2}
\subsection{Question}
If $A$ is a non-trivial zero-dimensional ring, prove that $A[x]$ is one-dimensional.
\subsection{Answer}

\section{Question 3}
\subsection{Question}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use the correspondence between irreducible subsets of Spec $A$ and their generic points to show that for any ring $A$ and any $\mathfrak{p} \in $ Spec $A$, the closed subset $V(\mathfrak{p})$ is an irreducible component of Spec $A$ if and only if $\mathfrak{p}$ is a \emph{minimal} prime ideal of $\mathfrak{p}$ (i.e. does not properly contain any other prime ideals of $A$).
\item  Use the general existence result for  irreducible components to conclude that \emph{any} prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ of Spec $A$ contains a minimal prime ideal.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Answer}

\section{Question 4}
\subsection{Question}
Prove that $A[x]$ is 2-dimensional if $A$ is a PID (not a field).
